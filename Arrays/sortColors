QUES: Sort an array of 1's, 0's and 2's without using extra space or sorting algo.
                 
INPUT - [2,0,2,1,1,0]     
OUTPUT - [0,0,1,1,2,2]

                                         Simply sort the array with T.C - O(nLogn) and S.C - O(1)

                                          Traverse the loop and then count for each 0,1,2 . 
                                          Then run the loop to assign the value in correct order.

                                          Using Dutch National Flag Algorithm. with three pointers ---> low,mid,high
Three conditions : when the mid points at 0,1,2

Case 1 :  when mid at 0
          swap mid and low
          low++ , mid+
Case 2 : when mid at 1
         mid++
Case 3: when mid at 2
          swap mid and high
          high--
