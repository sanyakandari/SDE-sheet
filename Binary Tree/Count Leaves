Given a Binary Tree of size N , You have to count leaves in it. For example, there are two leaves in following tree

        1
     /      \
   10      39
  /
5

 Given Tree is 
               4

           /     /   \
          7     5     1
         /
        3 
Output:
3
Explanation: 
Three leaves are 3 , 5 and 1.

JAVA CODE-
class Tree
{   
    int countLeaves(Node node) 
    {
         // Your code  
         if(node==null)
           return 0;
          if(node.left==null && node.right==null)
             return 1;
           
         return countLeaves(node.left)+countLeaves(node.right);
        
    }
}
