Given a binary tree and target node. By giving the fire to the target node and fire starts to spread in a complete tree. The task is to print the sequence of the burning nodes of a binary tree.
Rules for burning the nodes : 

Fire will spread constantly to the connected nodes only.
Every node takes the same time to burn.
A node burns only once.

Input : 
                       12
                     /     \
                   13       10
                          /     \
                       14       15
                      /   \     /  \
                     21   24   22   23
target node = 14

Output :
14
21, 24, 10
15, 12
22, 23, 13


JAVA CODE-
//global queue
Queue<Node> queue= new LinkedList<>();
public static int burningtree(Node root, int targetnode)
{
    if(root==null)
       return 0;
    
    if(root.data==targetnode)
    {
