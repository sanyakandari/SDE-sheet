Given below is a binary tree. The task is to print the top view of binary tree. Top view of a binary tree is the set of nodes visible when the tree is viewed from the top. For the given below tree

       1
    /     \
   2       3
  /  \    /   \
4    5  6   7

Top view will be: 4 2 1 3 7
Note: Return nodes from leftmost node to rightmost node.

#USING BFS AND HASHMAP
