BUBBLE SORT: Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
OBSERVATION:
1.5 elements, no. of pass=4
          for n elements , no.of pass=n-1
2. NO. of comparison, =4+3+2+1=10 (for 4 pass)
3. After 1st pass, largest element at correct place
   after kth pass, largest kth element on last kth position
   
   ( 5 1 4 2 8 )->( 1 4 2 5 8 )//AFTER 1ST PASS

T.C=O(N^2)
S.C=O(1)
NATURE: STABLE,INPLACE SORTING

JAVA CODE:
 void bubblesort(int arr[])
 {
   int n= arr.length;
   for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++)
   {
     for(int j=0;j<n;j++)
     { 
     //check if element on right place
      if(arr[j]>arr[j+1]
         {//swap the values
            int t=arr[j];
            arr[j]=arr[j+1];
            arr[j+1]=t;
          }
       }
    }
