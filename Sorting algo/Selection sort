SELECTION SORT -
By finding the min element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning
The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.
1) The subarray which is already sorted. 
2) Remaining subarray which is unsorted.

OBSERVATIONS:-
1. after 1st pass, we are placing the smallest element at index0
2. afer 2nd pass, we are placing the smallest 2 element at first 2 places
3.after kth pass, we are placing the smallestk elements at the first kth place

no of pass=n-1
//AFTER 1ST PASS
64 25 12 22 11 ->11 25 12 22 64 
//POSITION SWAP B/W 64 AND 11

T.C=O(N^2)
S.C=O(1)

JAVA CODE:=

void selectionSort(int arr[],int n)
{
  for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++)
   {  
      int min=i;
      for(int j=i+1;j<n;j++)
      { 
         //find the min element
         if(arr[j]<arr[min])
            min=j;
          //swap smallest element with first element
           int t=arr[min];
           arr[min]= arr[i];
           arr[i]=t;
        }
     }
  }
