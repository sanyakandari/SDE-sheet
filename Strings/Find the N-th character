Given a binary string S . Perform R iterations on string S, where in each iteration 0 becomes 01 and 1 becomes 10. Find the Nth character (considering 0 based indexing) of the string after performing these R iterations. 
(See Examples for better understanding)

Input:
S = 101
R = 2 
N = 3
Output:
1
Explanation : 
After 1st iteration S becomes 100110.
After 2nd iteration, S = 100101101001
Now, we can clearly see that the character
at 3rd index is 1, and so the output.

JAVA CODE-
class Solution
{
    public char nthCharacter(String S, int R, int N)
    { 
        String res="";
        for(int j=0;j<R;j++){
        for(int i=0;i<S.length();i++)
        {
            if(S.charAt(i)=='0')
               res=res+"01";
            if(S.charAt(i)=='1')
               res=res+"10";
        }
        S=res;  //re initiatize string s
        res="";  //new string res
        }
        char ans= S.charAt(N);
        return ans;
        
        
    }
}
