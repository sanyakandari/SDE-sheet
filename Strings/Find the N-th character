Given a binary string S . Perform R iterations on string S, where in each iteration 0 becomes 01 and 1 becomes 10. Find the Nth character (considering 0 based indexing) of the string after performing these R iterations. 
(See Examples for better understanding)

Input:
S = 101
R = 2 
N = 3
Output:
1
Explanation : 
After 1st iteration S becomes 100110.
After 2nd iteration, S = 100101101001
Now, we can clearly see that the character
at 3rd index is 1, and so the output.
